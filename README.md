Windows Dam Analysis Modules (WinDAM) is a set of modular software components that can be used to analyze overtopping and internal erosion of embankment dams. Dakota is an extensive software framework for design exploration and simulation. These tools can be coupled to create a powerful framework. This repository contains an eclipse text editor plug-in which will aid the writing of input files for this framework. Our goal is to create a text editor with features such as syntax coloring, content assist, and annotations to help users easily create input files for analysis.
